intro:

    **Real Change is a fund for Oldham that pays for items that local people
    need to end and prevent homelessness.**

    All but 5% goes **directly** to people who are homeless via partner
    charities. In fact, if you select gift aid while donating we can even
    increase your donation! 


    Not a penny goes to salaries for running the campaign. This is because Real
    Change partners have committed the time and energy of their staff to help
    run the campaign for free.

how:
  body: >-
    Your donation is combined with other donations into one central pot for
    everyone in Oldham Borough. [Local charities](/how-to-apply/) and
    organisations then work directly with individuals who are homeless, and
    apply for funds to pay for items they need. Money is transferred to the
    partner organisations to get where it is needed as quickly as possible, but
    is never given out as cash. 


    There are three types of application:

      If the request is for under £100, applications which meet the criteria are
      approved almost immediately.


      This excludes cash, emergency accommodation, food or other items which are
      available for free elsewhere.
    heading: £20-100

      for interviews)
  card2:

      representatives of support groups and accomodation providers.
