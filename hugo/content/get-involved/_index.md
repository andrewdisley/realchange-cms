  Whether you're interested in getting involved personally, on behalf of your
  community group, workplace or college, or as a business, there are many ways
  you can help. Get in touch by emailing <mailto:info@realchangerochdale.co.uk>
  with any inquiries.


  <br>


  As well as [donating](https://secure.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/31176)
  directly to the fund, you might want to:


  <br>


  ## **Take part in a "fundraising challenge"**


  Sign up to a sponsored run, walk or anything you like and raise money for
  people in your area who are homeless.


  Check out [Just Giving's Fundraising
  Toolkit](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tips/fundraising-page-toolkit)
  too, including Top 10 Tips and ideas for promoting your page.


  <br>


  ## **Invite us to speak at an event**


  Our Action Group includes people with lived experience of homelessness as well
  as charities working directly with people who are homeless. 


  We'd be delighted to come and talk to you about the Campaign at an event you
  are involved in organising, whether that's the weekly meeting at your church,
  a concert/cultural event, a conference your business in putting on or your
  sports team's AGM. 


  <br>


  ## **Play a role in organising Campaign activities**


  There are lots of roles that need doing to make the campaign a success,
  including:


  \- - Helping us spread the word by sponsoring public advertising space (JC
  Decaux are matching any ads we can fund-raise for so we reach a bigger
  audience in your local area)


  \- Supporting our efforts to get the message out via social media


  \- Helping administer grants to people who are homeless


  \- Being an 'ambassador' for the campaign within a specific area of the
  borough, or with particular networks such as colleges, churches or community
  groups.


  <br>


  ## **Share your skills or knowledge**


  What are you good at? What do you know lots about? How do you think a campaign
  like ours could benefit from that? There are no bad ideas and we'd love to
  hear yours! 


  <br>


  Every bit helps, so if you want to help people in your area who are homeless,
  please [get in touch](mailto:info@realchangerochdale.co.uk) or [sign up to our
  mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gbvxdn) so we can keep you up to date.
