    well as charities working directly with people who are homeless. 


    We'd be delighted to come and talk to you about the Campaign at an event you
    are involved in organising, whether that's the weekly meeting at your
    church, a concert/cultural event, a conference your business in putting on
    or your sports team's AGM.

    There are lots of roles that need doing to make the campaign a success,
    including:


    * Helping us spread the word by sponsoring public advertising space (JC
    Decaux are matching any ads we can fund-raise for so we reach a bigger
    audience in your local area)


    * Supporting our efforts to get the message out via social media


    * Helping administer grants to people who are homeless


    * Being an 'ambassador' for the campaign within a specific area of the
    borough, or with particular networks such as colleges, churches or community
    groups.
